# What's that book

Basic book search app built in React (hosted on Netlify [here](https://whats-that-book.netlify.app)) that allows the user to search for a book or author, displays results, and then allows the user to see a detailed view of any of the results. To get the data, it sends off the request to a simple Node.js [backend](https://github.com/katshaze/whats-that-book-server) that connects through to the Goodreads API to look up the book searched and send back results.
